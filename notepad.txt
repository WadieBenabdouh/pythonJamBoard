Naming Conventions
Here are some python naming conventions:
- Package and module names are all lower case
- Classes are declared in bumpy case with first letter of the individual words capitalized.
For instance: 

“CustomerProductRecord” is a valid class name.

- For methods and functions convention is to use
lowercase letters with individual words separated by
underscores. For example person_name, get_age etc.
